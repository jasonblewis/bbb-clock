* BBB Clock
Beaglebone Black 7 Segment Display Clock with TL5947 SPI PWM LED Drivers
** To Compile:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make clock
#+end_SRC bash
** Testing
*** Walk the digits displaying numbers 0-9
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
for d in {0..3} ; do for i in {0..9} ; do  ./clock -d $d -v $i -g 1000; sleep 1; done; done
#+END_SRC

*** Walk the segments, displaying 1 segment at a time
* Startup processes
** tsl2561 daemon - reads the ambient brightness and reports to clock process
** rtc - runs the real time clock 
** displayon - turns the display on - not convinced this is the best approach. will move to the c program
** clock - starts the clock daemon that manages the display
